Rebuilding [VillageGreenPreserver's amazing HUD](https://github.com/VillageGreenPreserver/VCRHud) to make more competitive.
I love the style and the assets but the vertical HP and ammo were a bit too hard for me to read. And the side bar made my already small screen smaller.

To-Do:
 - Make on screen HP & Ammo the default
 - Remove RHS blue bar
 - Fix HiDPI scaling in menus
 - Add player count (icons) to top of screen
 - Add ConTracker
 - Maintain original theme throughout

VillageGreenPreserver's Original Warning:
Make sure to run the command mat_viewportscale 1 to scale the game back to normal after uninstalling
